    Blue is my favorite color! It’s the color of the sky on a sunny day and the big, deep ocean. I love blue because it makes me feel calm and happy.

    Did you know that blue is also the color of superheroes like the ones who protect the world? It reminds me of feeling brave and strong, just like them!

  <h2>A Fun Story About Blue</h2>
  <p>
    One day, I was painting a picture of a beach. I ran out of blue paint while coloring the ocean! So, I had to mix other colors to make my own blue. It was so much fun! My picture turned out amazing, and everyone thought the ocean looked magical.

  <p>
    That’s why blue is my favorite—it’s magical, peaceful, and full of surprises!
